# Trace Formulas for Prime-Shift Operators

## Overview

This document develops trace-type constructions associated with prime-shift operators
acting on arithmetic Hilbert spaces. It provides the structural bridge between
operator theory and explicit formulas in analytic number theory.

Rather than postulating trace formulas axiomatically, the paper analyzes which
trace objects are admissible for unbounded arithmetic operators and how they must
be regularized to carry arithmetic meaning.

---

## Purpose

The goals of this work are:

- to clarify how trace-like expressions arise for prime-shift operators
- to identify which trace constructions are structurally meaningful
- to analyze regularization and cutoff dependence
- to prepare a rigorous interface to explicit formula diagnostics

This document is structural and analytical, not conjectural.

## Key Concepts

- Prime-shift operators on ℓ²(N)
- Regularized traces (heat-type, smoothed traces)
- Spectral test functions
- Prime–spectrum dual expansions
- Failure modes of naive trace constructions

---

## Position in the SMRK Program

This work sits between:

- operator construction and self-adjointness analysis
- explicit formula papers and numerical diagnostics

It justifies why explicit formula residuals can be interpreted as trace defects.

---

## Status

- Rigorous framework-level analysis
- Compatible with classical explicit formulas
- No claim of closed-form trace identities
- No claim regarding the Riemann Hypothesis

## Recommended Reading Order

1. SMRK Hamiltonian construction
